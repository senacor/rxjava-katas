The four-engine 747 uses a [[double-deck aircraft|double deck]] configuration for part of its length. It is available in passenger, freighter and other versions. Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. Boeing did so because the company expected [[Supersonic transport|supersonic airliners]] (development of which was announced in the early 1960s) to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete, while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust well into the future.<ref>Orlebar 2002, p. 50.</ref> The 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold,<ref>Haenggi 2003, pp. 14–15.</ref> but it exceeded critics' expectations with production passing the 1,000 mark in 1993.<ref name=Sutter_p259>Sutter 2006, p. 259.</ref> By November 2015, 1,519 aircraft had been built, with 20 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order.<ref name=747_O_D_summ>[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=747&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=747&ViewReportF=View+Report "747 Model Orders and Deliveries data."] ''The Boeing Company'', November 2015.

==Development==

===Background===
In 1963, the [[United States Air Force]] started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft. Although the [[C-141 Starlifter]] was being introduced, they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft. These studies led to initial requirements for the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of {{convert|180000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} and a speed of Mach 0.75 ({{convert|500|mph|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and an unrefueled range of {{convert|5000|nmi|km|sigfig=3}} with a payload of {{convert|115000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}. The payload bay had to be {{convert|17|ft|m|sigfig=3}} wide by {{convert|13.5|ft|m|sigfig=3}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=3}} long with access through doors at the front and rear.<ref name=Norton_C-5>Norton 2003, pp. 5–12.</ref>

Featuring only four engines, the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. On May 18, 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[Martin Marietta]]; while engine proposals were submitted by [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Curtiss-Wright]], and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.<ref name=Norton_C-5/>

All three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was. All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small "pod" just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long "spine" running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing.<ref>[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html "Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom."] ''NASA'', 2000, see images in "Langley Contributions to the C-5". Retrieved: December 17, 2007.</ref> In 1965 Lockheed's aircraft design and General Electric's engine design were selected for the new [[C-5 Galaxy]] transport, which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time.<ref name=Norton_C-5/> The nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 12–13.</ref>

===Airliner proposal===
The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s.<ref name=Norris_Wagner_p13>Norris and Wagner 1997, p. 13.</ref> The era of commercial jet transportation, led by the enormous popularity of the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], had revolutionized long-distance travel.<ref name=Norris_Wagner_p13/><ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120111124513/http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/commercial/707-03.html "Boeing Multimedia Image Gallery 707"].

During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a large new aircraft.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/jtrippe.html "Innovators: Juan Trippe."] ''PBS''. Retrieved: December 17, 2007.</ref>

In 1965, [[Joe Sutter]] was transferred from Boeing's [[Boeing 737|737]] development team to manage the design studies for a new airliner, already assigned the model number 747.<ref name=Sutter_p80-4>Sutter 2006, pp. 80–84.</ref> Sutter initiated a design study with Pan Am and other airlines, to better understand their requirements. At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by [[supersonic transport]] aircraft.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/852087.stm "Air travel, a supersonic future?."] ''BBC News'', July 17, 2001. Retrieved: December 9, 2007.</ref> Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. In the freighter role, the clear need was to support the [[Containerization|containerized shipping]] methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time. Standard containers are {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} square at the front (slightly higher due to attachment points) and available in {{convert|20|and|40|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} lengths. This meant that it would be possible to support a 2-wide 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX-HLS project.

In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 747-100 aircraft for US$525&nbsp;million. During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be "... a great weapon for peace, competing with [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental missiles]] for mankind's destiny".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rfpsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA31|title=The Airbus A380: A History|last=Simons|first=Graham|year=2014|page=31}}</ref> As launch customer,<ref name=ucfc747>Rumerman, Judy.

===Design effort===
Ultimately, the high-winged CX-HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747, although technologies developed for their bid had an influence.<ref>[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html "Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom."] ''NASA'', 2000.

The project was designed with a new methodology called [[fault tree analysis]], which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems.<ref name=ucfc747/> To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces.<ref name=Sutter_p121-31>Sutter 2006, pp. 121, 128–131.</ref> Additionally, some of the most advanced [[high-lift device]]s used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included [[leading-edge slats|slats]] running almost the entire length of the wing, as well as complex three-part slotted [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] along the trailing edge of the wing.<ref>Guy and Wagner 1997, pp. 25–26.</ref> The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.<ref>Jenkins 2000, p. 19.</ref>

Boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969.

As Boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner, they chose to build a new plant. The company considered locations in about 50 cities,<ref>Pascall, Glenn R.

Developing the 747 had been a major challenge, and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking. Boeing president [[William M. Allen]] asked Malcolm T. Stamper, then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee construction of the [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett factory]] and to start production of the 747.<ref>Boyer, Tom.

===Development and testing===
[[File:Boeing 747 rollout (3).jpg|thumb|left|The prototype 747 was first displayed to the public on September 30, 1968]]

Before the first 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many components and systems. One important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel.<ref name=Irving_p383>Irving 1994, p. 383.</ref> Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual training device known as "Waddell's Wagon" (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.<ref name=hist747>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100316193220/http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/747.html "History – "747 Commercial Transport."] ''The Boeing Company''.

During later stages of the flight test program, [[Wing flutter|flutter]] testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components. However, a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting [[depleted uranium]] counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine [[nacelle]]s of the early 747s.<ref name=Irving_p428>Irving 1994, p. 428.</ref> This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed, as did [[China Airlines Flight 358]] at [[Wanli, Taipei|Wanli]] in 1991 and [[El Al Flight 1862]] at [[Amsterdam]] in 1992 which had {{convert|282|kg|lb}} of uranium in the [[tailplane]].<ref>Uijt de Haag, P.A. et al.

The 747 line was further developed with the launch of the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the [[seating capacity]] of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected.

==Variants==
The 747-100 was the original variant launched in 1966. The 747-200 soon followed, with its launch in 1968. The 747-300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747-400 in 1985. Ultimately, the 747-8 was announced in 2005. Several versions of each variant have been produced, and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously. The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) classifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designator (e.g. "B741" for all -100 models).<ref name=ICAOcode>[http://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8643/Pages/Search.aspx "ICAO Document 8643."] ''International Civil Aviation Organization.''

While the 747-100 powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US domestic operations, it was marginal for long international route sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved -200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the -100. A few early -200s retained the three-window configuration of the -100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side.<ref>[http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/aviation/spot747.html "747 windows."] ''Plexoft''.

===Undeveloped variants===
Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage.

====747 trijet====
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with [[trijet|three engines]], to compete with the smaller [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|L-1011 TriStar]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]]. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an [[S-duct]] intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 69–71.</ref>

====747 ASB====
Boeing announced the 747 ASB (''Advanced Short Body'') in 1986 as a response to the [[Airbus A340]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]. This aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]] with the foreshortened 747SP fuselage. The aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boeing offers 747ASB|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1986/1986%20-%201260.PDF |work=Flight International |date=7 June 1986 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>  However, airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the [[Boeing 777|777]].

====747-500X, -600X, and -700X====
[[File:FAA comparison of Boeing 747-500X and 747-600X.jpg|thumb||The proposed 747-500X and -600X as depicted in an 1998 [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] illustration|alt=Aircraft comparison diagram.]]

Boeing announced the 747-500X and -600X at the 1996 [[Farnborough Airshow]].<ref name=boe_1996/> The proposed models would have combined the 747's [[fuselage]] with a new 251&nbsp;ft (77&nbsp;m) span wing derived from the 777. Other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.<ref name=faa_nla>Patterson, James W.

The 747-500X concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18&nbsp;ft (5.5&nbsp;m) to 250&nbsp;ft (76.2&nbsp;m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700&nbsp;nautical miles (10,000&nbsp;mi, 16,100&nbsp;km), with a gross weight of over 1.0&nbsp;[[Mega-|Mlb]] (450&nbsp;tonnes).<ref name=faa_nla/> The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279&nbsp;ft (85&nbsp;m) with seating for 548 passengers, a range of up to 7,700&nbsp;nmi (8,900&nbsp;mi, 14,300&nbsp;km), and a gross weight of 1.2&nbsp;Mlb (540&nbsp;tonnes).<ref name=faa_nla/> A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400.<ref name=boe_1996/> The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, was estimated to be more than US$5&nbsp;billion.<ref name=boe_1996/> Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.<ref name=FI_500X/>

====747X and 747X Stretch====
As Airbus progressed with its [[Airbus A380|A3XX]] study, Boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000; a more modest proposal than the previous -500X and -600X that retained the 747's overall wing design and add a segment at the root, increasing the span to {{convert|229|ft|m|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=boe_747X>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20000302203732/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_000121a.html "Boeing 747 Celebrates 30 Years In Service."] ''The Boeing Company'', September 2, 1996.

[[File:Qantas Boeing 747-438ER VH-OEI at LAX.jpg|thumb|The 747-400ER was derived from the 747-400X study.|alt=Side view of quadjet in flight.]]

Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]] concept.<ref name=shelv_747X/> Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X did not make it beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the [[Boeing 747-400ER|747-400ER]].<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20010124062000/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_001128c.html "Boeing Launches New, Longer-Range 747-400."] ''The Boeing Company''.

====747-400XQLR====
After the end of the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980&nbsp;nmi (9,200&nbsp;mi, 14,800&nbsp;km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise.<ref name=Boe_747-400XQLR>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20020306000939/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2002/q1/nr_020225h.html "Boeing Offers New 747-400X Quiet Longer Range Jetliner."] ''The Boeing Company'', February 26, 2002.

Few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747. The [[Tenerife airport disaster]] resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]] and [[China Airlines Flight 611]] crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. [[United Airlines Flight 811]], which suffered an [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military [[global positioning system]] (GPS) for civilian use.<ref name=KAL007>[http://www.america.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2006&m=February&x=20060203125928lcnirellep0.5061609 "United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology."]{{Dead link|date=November 2015}} ''america.gov,'' February 3, 2006.

Accidents due to design errors included [[TWA Flight 800]], where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank;<ref name=TWA_800_final>{{cite journal|title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB/AAR-00/03 |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |format=PDF |date=August 23, 2000 |pages= |accessdate=June 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130615201201/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2013 }}</ref> this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an [[inerting system]] in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008, after years of research into solutions.
